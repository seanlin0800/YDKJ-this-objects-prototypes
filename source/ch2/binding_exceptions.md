## Binding Exceptions

As usual, there are some *exceptions* to the "rules".

The `this`-binding behavior can in some scenarios be surprising, where you intended a different binding but you end up with binding behavior from the *default binding* rule (see previous).

### Ignored `this`

If you pass `null` or `undefined` as a `this` binding parameter to `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, those values are effectively ignored, and instead the *default binding* rule applies to the invocation.

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo.call( null ); // 2
```

Why would you intentionally pass something like `null` for a `this` binding?

It's quite common to use `apply(..)` for spreading out arrays of values as parameters to a function call. Similarly, `bind(..)` can curry parameters (pre-set values), which can be very helpful.

```js
function foo(a,b) {
	console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
}

// spreading out array as parameters
foo.apply( null, [2, 3] ); // a:2, b:3

// currying with `bind(..)`
var bar = foo.bind( null, 2 );
bar( 3 ); // a:2, b:3
```

Both these utilities require a `this` binding for the first parameter. If the functions in question don't care about `this`, you need a placeholder value, and `null` might seem like a reasonable choice as shown in this snippet.

**Note:** We don't cover it in this book, but ES6 has the `...` spread operator which will let you syntactically "spread out" an array as parameters without needing `apply(..)`, such as `foo(...[1,2])`, which amounts to `foo(1,2)` -- syntactically avoiding a `this` binding if it's unnecessary. Unfortunately, there's no ES6 syntactic substitute for currying, so the `this` parameter of the `bind(..)` call still needs attention.

However, there's a slight hidden "danger" in always using `null` when you don't care about the `this` binding. If you ever use that against a function call (for instance, a third-party library function that you don't control), and that function *does* make a `this` reference, the *default binding* rule means it might inadvertently reference (or worse, mutate!) the `global` object (`window` in the browser).

Obviously, such a pitfall can lead to a variety of *very difficult* to diagnose/track-down bugs.

#### Safer `this`

Perhaps a somewhat "safer" practice is to pass a specifically set up object for `this` which is guaranteed not to be an object that can create problematic side effects in your program. Borrowing terminology from networking (and the military), we can create a "DMZ" (de-militarized zone) object -- nothing more special than a completely empty, non-delegated (see Chapters 5 and 6) object.

If we always pass a DMZ object for ignored `this` bindings we don't think we need to care about, we're sure any hidden/unexpected usage of `this` will be restricted to the empty object, which insulates our program's `global` object from side-effects.

Since this object is totally empty, I personally like to give it the variable name `ø` (the lowercase mathematical symbol for the empty set). On many keyboards (like US-layout on Mac), this symbol is easily typed with `⌥`+`o` (option+`o`). Some systems also let you set up hotkeys for specific symbols. If you don't like the `ø` symbol, or your keyboard doesn't make that as easy to type, you can of course call it whatever you want.

Whatever you call it, the easiest way to set it up as **totally empty** is `Object.create(null)` (see Chapter 5). `Object.create(null)` is similar to `{ }`, but without the delegation to `Object.prototype`, so it's "more empty" than just `{ }`.

```js
function foo(a,b) {
	console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
}

// our DMZ empty object
var ø = Object.create( null );

// spreading out array as parameters
foo.apply( ø, [2, 3] ); // a:2, b:3

// currying with `bind(..)`
var bar = foo.bind( ø, 2 );
bar( 3 ); // a:2, b:3
```

Not only functionally "safer", there's a sort of stylistic benefit to `ø`, in that it semantically conveys "I want the `this` to be empty" a little more clearly than `null` might. But again, name your DMZ object whatever you prefer.

### Indirection

Another thing to be aware of is you can (intentionally or not!) create "indirect references" to functions, and in those cases,  when that function reference is invoked, the *default binding* rule also applies.

One of the most common ways that *indirect references* occur is from an assignment:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;
var o = { a: 3, foo: foo };
var p = { a: 4 };

o.foo(); // 3
(p.foo = o.foo)(); // 2
```

The *result value* of the assignment expression `p.foo = o.foo` is a reference to just the underlying function object. As such, the effective call-site is just `foo()`, not `p.foo()` or `o.foo()` as you might expect. Per the rules above, the *default binding* rule applies.

Reminder: regardless of how you get to a function invocation using the *default binding* rule, the `strict mode` status of the **contents** of the invoked function making the `this` reference -- not the function call-site -- determines the *default binding* value: either the `global` object if in non-`strict mode` or `undefined` if in `strict mode`.

### Softening Binding

We saw earlier that *hard binding* was one strategy for preventing a function call falling back to the *default binding* rule inadvertently, by forcing it to be bound to a specific `this` (unless you use `new` to override it!). The problem is, *hard-binding* greatly reduces the flexibility of a function, preventing manual `this` override with either the *implicit binding* or even subsequent *explicit binding* attempts.

It would be nice if there was a way to provide a different default for *default binding* (not `global` or `undefined`), while still leaving the function able to be manually `this` bound via *implicit binding* or *explicit binding* techniques.

We can construct a so-called *soft binding* utility which emulates our desired behavior.

```js
if (!Function.prototype.softBind) {
	Function.prototype.softBind = function(obj) {
		var fn = this,
			curried = [].slice.call( arguments, 1 ),
			bound = function bound() {
				return fn.apply(
					(!this ||
						(typeof window !== "undefined" &&
							this === window) ||
						(typeof global !== "undefined" &&
							this === global)
					) ? obj : this,
					curried.concat.apply( curried, arguments )
				);
			};
		bound.prototype = Object.create( fn.prototype );
		return bound;
	};
}
```

The `softBind(..)` utility provided here works similarly to the built-in ES5 `bind(..)` utility, except with our *soft binding* behavior. It wraps the specified function in logic that checks the `this` at call-time and if it's `global` or `undefined`, uses a pre-specified alternate *default* (`obj`). Otherwise the `this` is left untouched. It also provides optional currying (see the `bind(..)` discussion earlier).

Let's demonstrate its usage:

```js
function foo() {
   console.log("name: " + this.name);
}

var obj = { name: "obj" },
    obj2 = { name: "obj2" },
    obj3 = { name: "obj3" };

var fooOBJ = foo.softBind( obj );

fooOBJ(); // name: obj

obj2.foo = foo.softBind(obj);
obj2.foo(); // name: obj2   <---- look!!!

fooOBJ.call( obj3 ); // name: obj3   <---- look!

setTimeout( obj2.foo, 10 ); // name: obj   <---- falls back to soft-binding
```

The soft-bound version of the `foo()` function can be manually `this`-bound to `obj2` or `obj3` as shown, but it falls back to `obj` if the *default binding* would otherwise apply.
