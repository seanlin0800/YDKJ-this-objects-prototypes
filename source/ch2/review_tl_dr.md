## Review (TL;DR)

Determining the `this` binding for an executing function requires finding the direct call-site of that function. Once examined, four rules can be applied to the call-site, in *this* order of precedence:

1. Called with `new`? Use the newly constructed object.

2. Called with `call` or `apply` (or `bind`)? Use the specified object.

3. Called with a context object owning the call? Use that context object.

4. Default: `undefined` in `strict mode`, global object otherwise.

Be careful of accidental/unintentional invoking of the *default binding* rule. In cases where you want to "safely" ignore a `this` binding, a "DMZ" object like `Ã¸ = Object.create(null)` is a good placeholder value that protects the `global` object from unintended side-effects.

Instead of the four standard binding rules, ES6 arrow-functions use lexical scoping for `this` binding, which means they adopt the `this` binding (whatever it is) from its enclosing function call. They are essentially a syntactic replacement of `self = this` in pre-ES6 coding.
