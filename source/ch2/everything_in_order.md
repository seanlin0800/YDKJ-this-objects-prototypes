## Everything In Order

So, now we've uncovered the 4 rules for binding `this` in function calls. *All* you need to do is find the call-site and inspect it to see which rule applies. But, what if the call-site has multiple eligible rules? There must be an order of precedence to these rules, and so we will next demonstrate what order to apply the rules.

It should be clear that the *default binding* is the lowest priority rule of the 4. So we'll just set that one aside.

Which is more precedent, *implicit binding* or *explicit binding*? Let's test it:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( this.a );
}

var obj1 = {
	a: 2,
	foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 3,
	foo: foo
};

obj1.foo(); // 2
obj2.foo(); // 3

obj1.foo.call( obj2 ); // 3
obj2.foo.call( obj1 ); // 2
```

So, *explicit binding* takes precedence over *implicit binding*, which means you should ask **first** if *explicit binding* applies before checking for *implicit binding*.

Now, we just need to figure out where *new binding* fits in the precedence.

```js
function foo(something) {
	this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {
	foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {};

obj1.foo( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

obj1.foo.call( obj2, 3 );
console.log( obj2.a ); // 3

var bar = new obj1.foo( 4 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( bar.a ); // 4
```

OK, *new binding* is more precedent than *implicit binding*. But do you think *new binding* is more or less precedent than *explicit binding*?

**Note:** `new` and `call`/`apply` cannot be used together, so `new foo.call(obj1)` is not allowed, to test *new binding* directly against *explicit binding*. But we can still use a *hard binding* to test the precedence of the two rules.

Before we explore that in a code listing, think back to how *hard binding* physically works, which is that `Function.prototype.bind(..)` creates a new wrapper function that is hard-coded to ignore its own `this` binding (whatever it may be), and use a manual one we provide.

By that reasoning, it would seem obvious to assume that *hard binding* (which is a form of *explicit binding*) is more precedent than *new binding*, and thus cannot be overridden with `new`.

Let's check:

```js
function foo(something) {
	this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {};

var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
bar( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

var baz = new bar( 3 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( baz.a ); // 3
```

Whoa! `bar` is hard-bound against `obj1`, but `new bar(3)` did **not** change `obj1.a` to be `3` as we would have expected. Instead, the *hard bound* (to `obj1`) call to `bar(..)` ***is*** able to be overridden with `new`. Since `new` was applied, we got the newly created object back, which we named `baz`, and we see in fact that  `baz.a` has the value `3`.

This should be surprising if you go back to our "fake" bind helper:

```js
function bind(fn, obj) {
	return function() {
		fn.apply( obj, arguments );
	};
}
```

If you reason about how the helper's code works, it does not have a way for a `new` operator call to override the hard-binding to `obj` as we just observed.

But the built-in `Function.prototype.bind(..)` as of ES5 is more sophisticated, quite a bit so in fact. Here is the (slightly reformatted) polyfill provided by the MDN page for `bind(..)`:

```js
if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
	Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {
		if (typeof this !== "function") {
			// closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
			// internal IsCallable function
			throw new TypeError( "Function.prototype.bind - what " +
				"is trying to be bound is not callable"
			);
		}

		var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ),
			fToBind = this,
			fNOP = function(){},
			fBound = function(){
				return fToBind.apply(
					(
						this instanceof fNOP &&
						oThis ? this : oThis
					),
					aArgs.concat( Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments ) )
				);
			}
		;

		fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
		fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

		return fBound;
	};
}
```

**Note:** The `bind(..)` polyfill shown above differs from the built-in `bind(..)` in ES5 with respect to hard-bound functions that will be used with `new` (see below for why that's useful). Because the polyfill cannot create a function without a `.prototype` as the built-in utility does, there's some nuanced indirection to approximate the same behavior. Tread carefully if you plan to use `new` with a hard-bound function and you rely on this polyfill.

The part that's allowing `new` overriding is:

```js
this instanceof fNOP &&
oThis ? this : oThis

// ... and:

fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
fBound.prototype = new fNOP();
```

We won't actually dive into explaining how this trickery works (it's complicated and beyond our scope here), but essentially the utility determines whether or not the hard-bound function has been called with `new` (resulting in a newly constructed object being its `this`), and if so, it uses *that* newly created `this` rather than the previously specified *hard binding* for `this`.

Why is `new` being able to override *hard binding* useful?

The primary reason for this behavior is to create a function (that can be used with `new` for constructing objects) that essentially ignores the `this` *hard binding* but which presets some or all of the function's arguments. One of the capabilities of `bind(..)` is that any arguments passed after the first `this` binding argument are defaulted as standard arguments to the underlying function (technically called "partial application", which is a subset of "currying").

For example:

```js
function foo(p1,p2) {
	this.val = p1 + p2;
}

// using `null` here because we don't care about
// the `this` hard-binding in this scenario, and
// it will be overridden by the `new` call anyway!
var bar = foo.bind( null, "p1" );

var baz = new bar( "p2" );

baz.val; // p1p2
```

### Determining `this`

Now, we can summarize the rules for determining `this` from a function call's call-site, in their order of precedence. Ask these questions in this order, and stop when the first rule applies.

1. Is the function called with `new` (**new binding**)? If so, `this` is the newly constructed object.

    `var bar = new foo()`

2. Is the function called with `call` or `apply` (**explicit binding**), even hidden inside a `bind` *hard binding*? If so, `this` is the explicitly specified object.

    `var bar = foo.call( obj2 )`

3. Is the function called with a context (**implicit binding**), otherwise known as an owning or containing object? If so, `this` is *that* context object.

    `var bar = obj1.foo()`

4. Otherwise, default the `this` (**default binding**). If in `strict mode`, pick `undefined`, otherwise pick the `global` object.

    `var bar = foo()`

That's it. That's *all it takes* to understand the rules of `this` binding for normal function calls. Well... almost.
