# You Don't Know JS: *this* & Object Prototypes
# Chapter 5: Prototypes

In Chapters 3 and 4, we mentioned the `[[Prototype]]` chain several times, but haven't said what exactly it is. We will now examine prototypes in detail.

**Note:** All of the attempts to emulate class-copy behavior, as described previously in Chapter 4, labeled as variations of "mixins", completely circumvent the `[[Prototype]]` chain mechanism we examine here in this chapter.
